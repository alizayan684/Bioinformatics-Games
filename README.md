# ðŸ§¬ Local Alignment Game - README

Welcome to the **Local Alignment Game** - where bioinformatics meets fun! This interactive tool helps you understand the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment through hands-on visualization.

## ðŸŽ® What's This About?

This game demonstrates how local sequence alignment works in bioinformatics to find regions of similarity between DNA sequences. Unlike global alignment (which you might know from Needleman-Wunsch), local alignment finds the best matching subsequences without forcing the entire sequences to align.

## ðŸ§ª How to Play

1. **Enter two DNA sequences** (or use the defaults)
2. **Set your scoring parameters** (match, mismatch, gap)
3. Click **"Initialize Matrix"** to start
4. Use:
   - **Next Step** to move through the algorithm
   - **Auto Run** to watch automatically
   - **Guess Mode** to test your skills
5. Watch the traceback to see the optimal alignment!

## ðŸ§¬ The Science Behind It

Local alignment uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which:
- It builds a scoring matrix where each cell represents the best alignment ending at that position
- Never allows negative scores (sets them to 0)
- Finds "islands" of positive scores representing similar regions
- The highest score identifies the best local alignment

**Happy aligning!** May your matches be plenty and your gaps be few. ðŸ§¬âœ¨
